Description: Independent hypothesis weighting (IHW) is a multiple testing
    procedure that increases power compared to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg by assigning
    data-driven weights to each hypothesis. The input to IHW is a two-column
    table of p-values and covariates. The covariate can be any continuous-valued
    or categorical variable that is thought to be informative on the statistical
    properties of each hypothesis test, while it is independent of the p-value under
    the null hypothesis.
